Title: Electrode Circuit Schematic

- Two iridium-coated stainless steel needle electrodes.
- Differential amplifier stage (optional): Instrumentation amplifier (e.g., INA333) with gain configured to ~100x.
- RC low-pass filter on each input (~1 Hz cutoff) to suppress high-frequency noise.
- Connection to Arduino analog pins A0 and A1 for direct differential reading.
- Decoupling capacitors between supply rails (if amplifier used).
- Shielding and twisted pair cabling indicated.

Usage: Insert electrodes into mycelium substrate or fruit body, connect differential lines to amplifier (optional), then to Arduino.
